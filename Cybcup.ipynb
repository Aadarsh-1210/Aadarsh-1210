        "Explanation of the Code Flow:\n",
        "\n",
        "\t1.\tFirebase Initialization:\n",
        "\t•\tInitializes Firebase using your project credentials and sets up a reference to the Realtime Database for storing traffic data (CCTV, IoT, and GPS).\n",
        "\t•\tYou need to provide the path to the Firebase service account key and the Firebase Realtime Database URL in the code.\n",
        "\t2.\tData Collection (CCTV, IoT, GPS):\n",
        "\t•\tCCTV Data: Captures video frames using OpenCV and uploads metadata (e.g., timestamp and image path) to Firebase. The actual images can be stored in Google Cloud Storage or Firebase Storage (image paths are placeholders).\n",
        "\t•\tIoT Sensor Data: Simulates IoT sensor data (e.g., vehicle count and average speed) and pushes it to Firebase.\n",
        "\t•\tGPS Data: Simulates GPS data (e.g., latitude, longitude, and speed) and sends it to Firebase.\n",
        "\t3.\tAI-Based Traffic Prediction:\n",
        "\t•\tA simple Linear Regression model is used to predict optimal traffic signal timings based on vehicle count and average speed.\n",
        "\t•\tThe process_and_predict_traffic function handles the traffic prediction.\n",
        "\t4.\tTraffic Signal Control:\n",
        "\t•\tBased on the AI-predicted traffic signal timing, traffic signals can be controlled dynamically. This would be integrated into a real-world traffic signal control system using appropriate APIs or hardware controllers.\n",
        "\t5.\tRoute Suggestions:\n",
        "\t•\tThe suggest_optimal_route function suggests optimal routes for drivers based on current traffic conditions, using simple logic that compares average traffic speed.\n",
        "\t•\tThe generate_route_suggestions function provides the route suggestion based on real-time traffic data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "\t•\tFirebase Storage: If you store actual CCTV frames or any large files, consider using Google Cloud Storage or Firebase Storage for better handling of large media files.\n",
        "\t•\tGoogle Cloud Functions: The current setup is designed to run locally in a Python environment (e.g., Google Colab). For real-time updates, you can use Google Cloud Functions to trigger signal changes or route suggestions dynamically.\n",
        "\t•\tMultithreading: To run data collection and AI processing in parallel, you can use Python’s threading or multiprocessing libraries.\n",
